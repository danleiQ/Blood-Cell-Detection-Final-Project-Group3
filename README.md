# Object-Detection
The object of this project is to apply several machine learning algorithms used for object detection on both images and videos, with the purpose of making a comparison of different methods and exploring the applicability and performance of each algorithm.
The image dataset is from Kaggle.com, which is a collaborative release of 9 million images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, and visual relationships. The links is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/open-images-2019-object-detection/data. And the videos are filmed by us.
Several developed methods based on CNN are explored including R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN and Yolo.
Multiple indicators including IoU (intersection over union), AP and mAP score (average precision, mean average precision), and also Precision and Recall score are used to judge the performance of the network
